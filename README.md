### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Cosmin, a software developer for [VoIPIT Romania](https://voipit.ro), where I manage [Accolades](https://www.accolades.ro/en/info/), a cloud based call center platform.

My main open source project is called [Antheia](https://github.com/cosminstaicu/antheia), a frontend responsive library written in PHP. The library is used by most of my apps, either for VoIPIT or other private projects.

PHP is my main programming language. But, as you can not create an entire app using only that, I also use:
 - HTML, CSS, JavaScript (frontend);
 - PHP, NodeJS (backend);
 - MySQL, MariaDB (database);
 - Bash (various actions).
 
 Since most of my projects are cloud based apps, they are running on Linux servers (usually Ubuntu).
 
 I do all of my programming in Eclipse IDE, as it has all the features I need.
